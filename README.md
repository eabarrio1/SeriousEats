Front End Development Test

For QA purposes, it may be helpful to know that our audience are heavy users of Chrome (42%) and Safari (39%), but we also support Firefox (6%) and IE (5%, IE9 and greater).  Your results should be stored in a public Github repository on your account.  When submitting your results also include a brief description of how you approached the problem.  What tools did you use?  What was your workflow?  What, if any, challenges did you over come?  How did you approach browser/device testing?

1. As I worked, I took screenshots of the file on a browser and overlayed it on the original image to make sure font sizes, padding and margins were correct. I did this for Chrome, Safari and Firefox. I used Photoshop for this.

2. I used the Divide Mode Emulation tool on Google Chrome to check the object on different devices.

3. The first challenge was deciding how to approach the image in a mobile device. I decided to keep the font sizes the same in mobile so that they were still eyecatching enough and served as an obvious call to action.
