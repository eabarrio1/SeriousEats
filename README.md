Front End Development Test

For QA purposes, it may be helpful to know that our audience are heavy users of Chrome (42%) and Safari (39%), but we also support Firefox (6%) and IE (5%, IE9 and greater).  Your results should be stored in a public Github repository on your account.  When submitting your results also include a brief description of how you approached the problem.  What tools did you use?  What was your workflow?  What, if any, challenges did you over come?  How did you approach browser/device testing?

- As I worked, I took screenshots of the file on a browser and overlayed it on the original image to make sure font sizes, padding and margins were correct. I did this for Chrome, Safari and Firefox. I used Photoshop for this, and did it repeatedly throughout the process as I was tweaking the code. This was the first challenge.
- To test for IE, after the files were uploaded to GitHub I entered the repo directory on http://htmlpreview.github.io/. I then used a Chom extension called IE-On-Chrome to view the file in IE9, IE10 and IE11.
- I used LESS for the styling to be able to define variables at the top of the document.
- I own the Brandon Grotesque font, so I got the original .otf font and converted it to .woff, .svg, .ttf and .eot using https://onlinefontconverter.com/.
- I used the Divide Mode Emulation tool on Google Chrome to check the object on different devices.
- Another challenge was deciding how to approach the image in a mobile device. I decided to keep the font sizes the same in mobile so that they were still eyecatching enough and served as an obvious call to action.
